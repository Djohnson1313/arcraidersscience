# Purpose Of This Repository and Data Collection

Hey Raiders! In this repository, we will used publicly sources data to dive deep into the interworkings of [Arc Raiders](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/) to get a better understanding of spawn rates for items based on map, map condition and container type. This will hopefully alleviate some of the speculation regarding loot. I am aware of some similar undertakings by large youtube channels. Actually, those videos are what inspired me! hopefull we can come together to add as much data as we can to a singular place, allowing any creator or fan of Arc Raiders to dive into the data themselves. As of right now, I will generate a single report based on the data from the community, however if this takes off, I would love to do more regular updates, maybe even weekly if theres enough activity! Please send any suggestions or complaints to arcscience13@proton.me.  

# Data TLDR

Here is where some analytics will be displayed once enough is sourced! See you topside raider!
